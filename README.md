## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a front-end developer committed to building accessible, inclusive web interfaces, with a focus on creating reusable UI components enhanced by ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes. This repository is where I document my work, experiments, and learning around making the web a better place for everyoneâ€”regardless of ability.

Accessibility is more than a feature; itâ€™s a foundation of good design. My goal is to ensure that every interactive element I buildâ€”whether itâ€™s a modal, dropdown, tab panel, or custom buttonâ€”is usable with a screen reader, keyboard navigation, and assistive technologies. Iâ€™m learning how to apply ARIA roles, states, and properties correctly to bridge the gap between custom UI patterns and semantic HTML.

This repository includes a collection of accessible components, built with HTML, CSS (often with utility-first frameworks), and JavaScript. Each component is carefully structured to follow WAI-ARIA guidelines, support full keyboard interaction, and offer clear, meaningful feedback to users. I also include usage notes and testing checklists to verify accessibility with tools like axe DevTools, NVDA, and VoiceOver.

Along the way, Iâ€™m deepening my understanding of WCAG standards, semantic markup, focus management, and the common pitfalls developers face when building non-native interactive elements. My approach prioritizes clarity, maintainability, and performance without sacrificing usability.

If youâ€™re passionate about web accessibility, or just getting started with ARIA and inclusive design, feel free to explore, reuse, or contribute to the code. I welcome feedback and collaboration from anyone who shares the goal of making the web more usable for all.

Thanks for visitingâ€”and hereâ€™s to building a more inclusive web, one accessible component at a time.
